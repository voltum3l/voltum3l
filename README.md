Hi.

I'm learning python and i hope learn BASH in the long term.
Currently swamping on cibersecurity, with a lot of hope and a little bit of knowledge.

Always ready to learn, find solutions.

I'm going to upload my rookie python proyects (very rookie, very amateur). Useless with love.
And i've lots of C# scripts because i'm a former video game developer (UNITY), maybe in next months i'll upload all my repository.

Open to work? Always.
Open to help? 24/7.

(sorry for my sad, weak english)
